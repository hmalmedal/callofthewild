The Call of the Wild
====================

Introduction
------------

This LaTeX package provides all 330 paragraphs from the novel *The Call
of the Wild* by Jack London.

Usage
-----

Load the package with `\usepackage{callofthewild}`.

The command `\callofthewild` outputs the first five paragraphs of the
novel.

breaks.

More paragraphs are available by using the optional argument, e.g.
`\callofthewild[20]` outputs the first twenty paragraphs.
